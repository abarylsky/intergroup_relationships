 abstractNote={This study examined the moderating role of child negative affect in the link between coparenting cooperation and child social competence. Cross-sectional data were collected from a community sample of 258 Chinese families with preschool children (mean age = 5.19 years; 47% of them were girls), residing in Hong Kong, China. Using questionnaires, parents (80% of them were mothers) rated their children's negative affect as well as their own coparenting cooperation, dyadic, parent-child nurturance, and marital love. Also, class teachers rated children's peer acceptance and social cognition using questionnaires, and children reported their own social competence in structured interviews. Multilevel and multiple regression models indicated that, controlling for dyadic, parent-child nurturance, and marital love, coparenting cooperation was positively associated with teachers' ratings of child peer acceptance and social cognition and children's reports of their own social competence. These associations, however, were significant only for children with high negative affect. Theoretically, these findings highlighted the importance of considering child dispositions when examining the contributions of family relationships to child development. Practically, parents, especially those with temperamentally difficult children, should learn to work cooperatively with each other to promote their children's social competence.

 title={Discrimination, Internalized Homonegativity, and Attitudes Toward Children of Same-Sex Parents: Can Secure Attachment Buffer Against Stigma Internalization?},
 volume={56},
 ISSN={00147370},
 DOI={10.1111/famp.12255},
 abstractNote={With increasing numbers of same-sex couples raising children in the United States, discriminatory attitudes toward children of same-sex parents ( ACSSP) are of increasing concern. As with other forms of stigma and discrimination, lesbian, gay, and bisexual ( LGB) individuals are at risk for internalizing these societal attitudes, which can negatively affect parenting-related decisions and behaviors and the mental and physical health of their children. Secure attachment is characterized by positive views of the self as loveable and worthy of care that are understood to develop in early relationships with caregivers. Secure attachment has been associated with positive mental and physical health, including among LGB individuals and couples. This study aimed to test the potential buffering role of secure attachment against stigma internalization by examining associations among secure attachment, discrimination, internalized homonegativity ( IH), and ACSSP in an online survey study of 209 U.S. adults in same-sex relationships. Bootstrap analyses supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model, with secure attachment being a buffer. Greater discrimination was indirectly associated with more negative ACSSP through greater IH for individuals with mean or lower levels, but not for individuals with higher than average levels of secure attachment, specifically because among those with higher levels of secure attachment, discrimination was not associated with IH. These findings build on and extend past research, with important implications for future research and clinical work with LGB individuals, same-sex couples, and their families, including potential implementation of interventions targeting attachment security.

  abstractNote={Parents differ in terms of what characteristics they value most for their children, and several studies by M. L. Kohn and others (1963, 1977, 1979) have demonstrated that these differences in values are related to social class. However, there is relatively little in the literature regarding the extent to which parental values are associated with parenting practices. In this study, data on 65 mother-infant dyads (infants aged 9-23 mo) were used to test a hypothesis, proposed by Kohn, regarding the relation between values and parenting behavior. The authors also examined the extent to which the data are consistent with this causal sequence: social class (affects) parental values (affects) childrearing beliefs (affects) parental behavior, essentially, an extension of Kohn's conceptual model. Support was found for Kohn's hypothesis and for the extension of Kohn's model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  volume={41},
  ISSN={00031224},
  abstractNote={Data from the 1973 NORC General Social Survey are used to examine some main themes from Kohn's Class and Conformity (1969). Here and in the original, the focus is on parental values for children, especially on the component of "self-direction versus conformity." The results indicate that (1) there have been sizable trends in the value of self-direction since Kohn's original survey; (2) while social class remains the primary determinant of self-direction values, as Kohn argues, the explanatory power of a "parental values" model is significantly increased through the inclusion of non-class variables; (3) the overall social class effect is apparently due more to educational attainment than occupational prestige. Some implications of these findings for subsequent research are also discussed.},

Participants completed an instrument specifically designed to measure early childhood teachers' beliefs and practices of using environmental, natural activity, and intensive instructional strategies to support children's social competence. Results found some similarities among South Korean and U.S. teachers that they both believe in and practice environmental, natural activity, and intensive strategies in the respective order from the most to the least. Results, however, also found some culture-specific differences that U.S. teachers rated all the strategies higher than South Korean teachers, and that stronger relationship between beliefs and practices were found among South Korean teachers. Sociocultural factors related to early childhood teachers' beliefs and practices about supporting children's social competence are discussed.},
