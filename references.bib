Cross-sectional data were collected from a community sample of 258 Chinese families with preschool children (mean age = 5.19 years; 47% of them were girls), residing in Hong Kong, China. Using questionnaires, parents (80% of them were mothers) rated their children's negative affect as well as their own coparenting cooperation, dyadic, parent-child nurturance, and marital love. Also, class teachers rated children's peer acceptance and social cognition using questionnaires, and children reported their own social competence in structured interviews. Multilevel and multiple regression models indicated that, controlling for dyadic, parent-child nurturance, and marital love, coparenting cooperation was positively associated with teachers' ratings of child peer acceptance and social cognition and children's reports of their own social competence. These associations, however, were significant only for children with high negative affect. Theoretically, these findings highlighted the importance of considering child dispositions when examining the contributions of family relationships to child development.

 volume={56},
 ISSN={00147370},
 DOI={10.1111/famp.12255},
 abstractNote={With increasing numbers of same-sex couples raising children in the United States, discriminatory attitudes toward children of same-sex parents ( ACSSP) are of increasing concern. As with other forms of stigma and discrimination, lesbian, gay, and bisexual ( LGB) individuals are at risk for internalizing these societal attitudes, which can negatively affect parenting-related decisions and behaviors and the mental and physical health of their children. Secure attachment is characterized by positive views of the self as loveable and worthy of care that are understood to develop in early relationships with caregivers. Secure attachment has been associated with positive mental and physical health, including among LGB individuals and couples. This study aimed to test the potential buffering role of secure attachment against stigma internalization by examining associations among secure attachment, discrimination, internalized homonegativity ( IH), and ACSSP in an online survey study of 209 U.S. adults in same-sex relationships. Bootstrap analyses supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model, with secure attachment being a buffer. Greater discrimination was indirectly associated with more negative ACSSP through greater IH for individuals with mean or lower levels, but not for individuals with higher than average levels of secure attachment, specifically because among those with higher levels of secure attachment, discrimination was not associated with IH. These findings build on and extend past research, with important implications for future research and clinical work with LGB individuals, same-sex couples, and their families, including potential implementation of interventions targeting attachment security.

Kohn and others (1963, 1977, 1979) have demonstrated that these differences in values are related to social class. However, there is relatively little in the literature regarding the extent to which parental values are associated with parenting practices. In this study, data on 65 mother-infant dyads (infants aged 9-23 mo) were used to test a hypothesis, proposed by Kohn, regarding the relation between values and parenting behavior. The authors also examined the extent to which the data are consistent with this causal sequence: social class (affects) parental values (affects) childrearing beliefs (affects) parental behavior, essentially, an extension of Kohn's conceptual model. Support was found for Kohn's hypothesis and for the extension of Kohn's model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstractNote={Data from the 1973 NORC General Social Survey are used to examine some main themes from Kohn's Class and Conformity (1969). Here and in the original, the focus is on parental values for children, especially on the component of "self-direction versus conformity." The results indicate that (1) there have been sizable trends in the value of self-direction since Kohn's original survey; (2) while social class remains the primary determinant of self-direction values, as Kohn argues, the explanatory power of a "parental values" model is significantly increased through the inclusion of non-class variables; (3) the overall social class effect is apparently due more to educational attainment than occupational prestige.

Methods: This study included 207 mothers, fathers, and their first-born child from toddlerhood through the preschool years. This study employed an Actor–Partner Interdependence Model which was developed to handle dyadic relationships to investigate the association between economic pressure, parental positivity, and positive parenting, separately for mother and father and the interdependent associations between them. Results: Results showed that economic pressure when the child was age 2 (Time 1) was negatively associated with maternal and paternal positivity and father positive parenting when the child was 3-4 years old (Time 2). Maternal positivity was associated with paternal positivity and mother positive parenting was associated with father positive parenting. In addition, maternal positivity was associated with mother positive parenting while paternal positivity was not significantly related to father positive parenting at Time 2. Parental positivity and positive parenting at Time 2 were both associated with child social competence at age 5 (Time 3), even after controlling for child social competence at age 2 (Time 1). Conclusions: The current results suggest that both maternal and paternal positivity and positive parenting are important protective factors for young children’s social competence even under times of economic adversity.

Based on a tripartite model, we tested the relationship between emotional and social competence and their contribution to externalizing and internalizing symptoms in a preschool-age community sample (N = 117, M = 4.67 years, SD = 2.75 months). We assessed teachers’ (N = 109) and parents’ (N = 77) perspective using the Strengths-and-Difficulties-Questionnaire and children’s perspective using the Berkeley-Puppet-Interview and a standardized emotional-competence-test (MeKKi). We found externalizing symptoms being negatively related to prosocial behavior in teachers’ and parents’ reports and positively related to social initiative in teachers’ reports. In teachers’ reports only, a mediation effect of emotional competence via social competence on externalizing symptoms was shown. Children, but not caregivers, reported internalizing symptoms being positively related to prosocial behavior. These results highlight the importance of multiple informants and especially of children’s self-perception in preschool-age psychopathology.

This article offers an expanded formulation. Internalization as a result of discipline is proposed to be based on a child's accurate perception of the parental message and acceptance or rejection of it. Mechanisms promoting acceptance are perceptions of the parent's actions as appropriate, motivation to accept the parental position, and perception that a value has been self-generated. Features of the misdeed, discipline technique, child, and parent that affect accurate perception and acceptance–rejection are outlined. Other goals besides internalization, such as movement beyond the parent's position, maintenance of the child's self-esteem, and maintenance of the parent–child relationship, are discussed.
